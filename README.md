# FileBot

This is a fork of the official FileBot source code on **23 Mar 2018** for version **4.8.0**.
The repo has unfortunately since been taken offline. It appears like the developer [rednoah](https://github.com/rednoah) has decided to try and make money off this software which originally rose in popularity due to its open source nature.

rednoah has:
* Added nagware to the original software to promote sales
* Made it intentionally harder to build the software
* Censored/removed posts on forums they moderate
* Deceived the community who supported the software
* Finally, removed the open source code from Github.

Stop making absurd excuses like "there were no other contributors" which is a complete lie. Just say you want to make money, there is nothing wrong with that but you can't seem to admit it.
